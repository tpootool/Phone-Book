************
Compilation
************
- Type 'make' into the command line
- This compiles two files in the bin subdirectory:
 > phoneBook (menu driven program)
 > test (hash table testing program)


***********************
Running the program(s)
***********************
- For the testing program type bin/test in the root of the folder
- For the assignment program type bin/phoneBook xxxx.txt in the root of the folder
 > xxx.txt is the name of the input file, the program will not run without an entry


*****************
Known Limitations
*****************
- In some input files, the sorting algorithm runs into errors
 > This is a result of one or more entries being sorted improperly
 > This causes the program to freeze upon choosing the print directory function
 > This causes the program to freeze upon searching the number that caused the error, however searching other numbers should be fine

- The program may freeze if an entry is added that causes the sorting algorithm to run into errors
 > This causes the program to freeze upon choosing the print directory function
 > This causes the program to freeze upon searching the number added that caused the error, however searching other numbers should be fine
 > If a number is added that does not cause the sorting algorithm to run into errors the program should run fine

- The print directory function will only print to the bottom of the window
 > This may be a result of using ncurses
 > If there are more entries in the directory than can fit on the screen, only the ones that will fit will be printed
 > This should have no impact on searching the numbers
