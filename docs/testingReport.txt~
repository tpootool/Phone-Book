Testing and design document for Assignment 2

DESIGN:

- This hash table was designed to fix collisions with a linked list strategy.
 > If there is a collision, the item being inserted will be placed in a linked list in that table position.
 > The item goes through a sorting algorithm to determine its location in the linked list.
 > This method was chosen because the amount of entries in the input file can be any number greater than (or equal to) 20, since the 
   absolute size is uncertain this method guarentees enough space since it is a dynamic approach.

- The hash function utilizes truncation and division to create a key.
 > The first two characters of the phone number are taken and converted to a single int.
 > The modulus function is performed on the int to determine its place in the hash table.
 > This was intended to have a hash table of size 10 (performing int % 10), however this caused errors.
 > These errors were not present when the size of the hash table was 100 (with int % 100).
 > The reasoning behind this is unclear, but this size was ultimately chosen for functionality.


TESTING:

-Tried making a hash table with 10 slots (less than 2/3 of the minimum size).
 > Resulted in program freezing.
 > Problem was avoided when larger table values were used.
 > Program runs a hash table with 100 slots.

-Tried creating a text file with a large number of entries.
 > With ncurses, the printing of the list cuts off at the bottom of the window.
 > Not all entries may get printed as a result of this.
 > If the individual entries are searched they will be found.

- With some files, there were errors printing and searching when items.
 > When there are files that cause these errors, the program will freeze when printing or searching.
 > This may be a result from sorting, however the cause of this was not determined completely.

- For adding individual entries
 > Tried adding an entry with proper data and was successful
 > Tried adding an entry with an incorrect number of digits for the phone number, user is prompted with an error message and returns to 
   the menu.

- For searching entries
 > Tried searching for a number with less than 10 digits, user is prompted with an error message and returns to the menu.
 > Tried searching for a number not in the directory, user is prompted with an error message and returns to the menu.
 > Tried searching for a number that is longer than 10 digits, user is prompted with an error message and returns to the menu.

- Tried pressing various buttons at the main menu
 > All keys other than the UP and DOWN arrows will select the current item.
